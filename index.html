            Introduction to Usability Report for Note-Taking Applications (Apps)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Note taking is a critical, organizational skill applied across our
            personal and professional lives. Note taking is a relevant skill to
            everyday tasks. A variety of note-taking applications are available
            to support users’ needs for professional, educational, and personal
            use. There are options to choose from when selecting a note-taking
            app. The features and actions within such apps ensure the options
            meet the user’s needs. It is also important to research usability
            with hopes of improving and/or developing a better product.

            This usability report outlines the results of a study designed to
            evaluate a new user’s experience with two note-taking apps: Obsidian
            and Notion. This report, developed by
            <span class="italic">Team E.S.C. (Everyone Stay Calm)</span>,
            analyzes the successes, usefulness, and pain points of a new user’s
            experience when onboarding the two apps. Based on the findings of
            the study, the report outlines a set of recommendations for a
            note-taking app prototype. The results reveal considerations that
            will serve our product manager persona. Research results also inform
            how someone might align UX with Calm Tech principles.

            Notion and Obsidian apps are two current, popular resources on the
            market for note taking. Both apps are applicable to this usability
            analysis and report. Each app offers worthwhile features dependent
            upon a user’s needs. This study will take an objective point of view
            that details what works and does not work for the user of each app.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following report shares the testing of six user experiences with
            the note-taking apps. The observational study looks at how users
            access each app, followed by four key tasks pertinent to note
            taking. A close look is taken at how a first-time user applies
            instructions and responds to actions within the app. The report
            begins with background information about the Notion and Obsidian
            apps. It includes an in-depth look at the workflows of each app, the
            methodology for user testing, and the elements of UX design. An
            analysis of the methodology for testing and data provides insight
            into effectiveness of the note-taking apps. Finally, a
            recommendation for an app prototype completes the process.
