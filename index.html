            Introduction to Usability Report for Note-Taking Applications (Apps)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Note taking is a critical, organizational skill applied across our
            personal and professional lives. There are a variety of note-taking
            apps with features and actions to ensure the app meets a user’s
            needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Team ESC (Everyone Stay Calm) developed a usability test to evaluate
            a new user’s experience with two note-taking apps: Obsidian and
            Notion. This report analyzes the successes, usefulness, and pain
            points of a new user’s experience during the onboarding process of
            each app. The report outlines a set of recommendations for a
            note-taking app prototype. The findings of the usability test and
            Calm Technology principles for non-intrusive design are integrated
            within the recommendations. The results reveal considerations that
            will serve our product manager persona in the development of a
            competitive product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notion and Obsidian are two current, popular note-taking apps. This
            study details what works and does not work for the user of each app.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following report shares the results of five participants who
            tested the note-taking apps. The observational study looks at how
            users access each app, followed by six key tasks pertinent to
            onboarding and basic note taking. A close look is taken at how a
            first-time user applies instructions and responds to the app
            interface of Notion or Obsidian.
