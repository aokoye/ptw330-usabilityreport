          <h2>Usability Results - Data Analysis of User Experience</h2>
          <p>In this usability test, we identified and applied:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>qualitative comments from interviews;</li>
            <li>responses from survey questions; and</li>
            <li>researcher observational analysis.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We used data triangulation to produce more precise findings relevant
            to our goals. Five users participated in the note-taking app
            usability test.
          </p>
          <p>
            This analysis identifies patterns, trends, and details associated
            with a new user’s experience of Notion or Obsidian. The following
            questions frame the analysis based on the compilation of data.
          </p>

          <h3>
            When does the user feel successful? What factors influence success
            with the note-taking app?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Users express delight when the app is functional, when it works
            within their mental model, and when it feels like it is designed for
            them. Participants in the usability test appreciate a sensible or
            familiar structure as they approach a new experience. They want
            success from the start and as they apply basic tasks within the app.
          </p>

          <h3>That Was Easy: User Success in Notion</h3>
          <p>
            Notion users report a positive experience with the simplicity of
            steps and basic functionality of the app. Top positive experiences
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Completing essential note-taking tasks easily.</li>
            <li>Downloading and accessing the app with ease.</li>
            <li>
              Using basic functions (creating formatting, locating, and
              maneuvering notes).
            </li>
            <li>
              Applying other intuitive skills (e.g., the plus sign to add item;
              the three-dot feature for contextual information).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Not so Fast: User Success in Obsidian</h3>
          <p>
            Obsidian users need extra time to explore the features and design of
            the app before expressing appreciation for the tool. They recognize
            power and potential in the app - once their ability to do tasks
            picks up.
          </p>
          <p>Top positive experiences in Obsidian include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Applying previously learned tech skills.</li>
            <li>Exploring features to see their relevance.</li>
            <li>Approaching the new experience with curiosity.</li>
            <li>Some users mentioned the power and possibility of Obsidian.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            What is a user experience like during onboarding of Notion or
            Obsidian?
          </h3>
          <h4>Notion Onboarding</h4>
          <p>
            Users did not mention training needed for onboarding. However, they
            did express confusion and curiosity about a series of onboarding
            questions when launching the app. Users were asked to make choices
            related to their purpose of using the app, their personal interests,
            and whether they wanted to collaborate or work individually in the
            app. Users shared:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "I wish I could use the app for more than one purpose, but I’m
              asked to choose between work, personal, or school use.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I do not know if I want to use this app for collaboration or not.
              I do not want to be stuck with that choice.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am wondering about the choices. Will this limit my app
              experience later?”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <h4>Obsidian Onboarding</h4>
          <p>
            Participants reported a strong desire to have training, a
            quick-start guide, or editorial notes to support the onboarding
            experience for Obsidian. Participants expressed a need to know how
            to find items, see where items are stored, and understand how to
            format text as they launch the app. Obsidian appears to new users as
            having a complex filing structure.
          </p>

          <h3>What tasks are confusing to the user?</h3>
          <h4>Notion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Folders:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Notion uses a nested system for storing notes. There are no
                  folders, per se. While participants in the usability test
                  figured this out, they found it odd to search for notes inside
                  of notes instead of searching by folder.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Templates:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  One user experienced confusion with a template that included
                  pre-completed information already inserted into the template.
                  This made the user wonder if the data was just an example or
                  another user’s data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another user was confused by finding crowd-sourced templates.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Obsidian</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Jargon - Vaults:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Obsidian users were confused by jargon and did not understand
                  vaults and templates. This was a point of repeated comments.
                  Every Obsidian user wanted to know what a vault is, where it
                  is located, and what is its function. They tried hovering over
                  items to help them understand the functionality of a vault.
                  Comments from users:
                  <blockquote>
                    “What is the difference between a vault and a note?"
                    <br />
                    “I don’t know what a vault is. How is a folder different
                    from a vault? ‘Vault’ sounds dark and ominous.”
                  </blockquote>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Templates:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Three users of Obsidian searched for access to templates but
                  found no folder with options.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They noticed that templates were either not configured into
                  the app or they gave up their search.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
