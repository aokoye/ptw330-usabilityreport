          <h2>About Notion and Obsidian</h2>
          <h3 id="notion">Notion</h3>
          <p>
            Notion is a note taking and all in one productivity application that
            was founded in 2013. It is available on all major mobile and desktop
            platforms and users can sync between them without paying a
            subscription fee. Notion is used by many companies, both large and
            small, including at least one Fortune 500 company. Notion has four
            payment levels aimed at different use cases. This starts from a free
            tier for individuals wanting basic functionality and goes up to the
            level of enterprise usage. At higher levels customers get a larger
            number of features and increased security. These features include
            the ability to integrate notion with GitHub, Slack, and Asana,
            collaboration with an unlimited number of users, and the ability to
            use Notion’s AI.
          </p>
          <h4 id="nfeatures">Features</h4>
          <p>
            Notion’s goal is to be an all-in-one answer to customers’
            productivity needs. For that reason, it has more features than can
            be listed here. That said, it’s easy to divide the features into
            three broad categories. Note taking, organization, and
            collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notion’s notetaking feature is very robust. Users can add 50+
            different types of content/content features including charts,
            images, and code. Users can also embed files from services such as
            Google Drive, Figma, and Confluence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organization is a core feature in Notion. On top of folder
            organization, Notion allows users to create tables, Gantt charts,
            and calendars. Users can also create Kanban charts and databases.
            Notes can be embedded in all of these which allows for a powerful
            organization system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notion has collaboration features for all payment levels of the app.
            Users can invite people to collaborate on individual notes or within
            larger projects. Note collaboration is similar to various word
            processors – users can add content to notes and comment on notes.
            There is also a version control system that allows users to see who
            made edits. When users are collaborating on large projects, they can
            add new notes and files to the project. This allows collaborators to
            have similar permissions as the owner of the project though the
            level of permissions can be changed by the owner.
          </p>
          <h3 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h3>
          <p>
            Obsidian is a note taking application that was released in 2020 and
            is available for desktop and mobile platforms (including Linux). It
            allows users to sync across devices, but only at paid subscription
            tiers. It has five subscription tiers with monthly and yearly
            payment options. Obsidian is used by multiple large organizations,
            companies, and governments including multiple Fortune 500 companies.
            Obsidian places a high importance on security and information
            protection. Synced data is protected using end-to-end encryption and
            as of May 2025, Obsidian has posted results of independent security
            audits on their website.
          </p>
          <h4 id="ofeatures">Features</h4>
          <p>
            Outside of security, Obsidian prides itself on its canvas feature
            and the ability to publish websites via Obsidian.
          </p>
          <p>
            The canvas feature allows users to create a visual display of their
            notes in a window (which Obsidian calls a “canvas”) that scrolls
            endlessly. PDFs, videos, images, and websites can also be embedded
            in the canvas. These embedded objects can be moved around the canvas
            and arrows can be drawn between these objects to show their
            relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obsidian allows users to publish websites with the app, a feature
            that they call Obsidian Publish. They support custom domain names
            and password protected areas of the website. Editing Obsidian
            Publish websites can be done in various ways. Users can use markdown
            to edit their site, download third-party themes, create their own
            themes, and edit their sites with HTML, limited CSS, and JavaScript.
            In this way it is similar to web building services like Wix and
            Weebly.
          </p>
          <h3 id="comparison">Comparison</h3>
          <p>
            When comparing Notion with Obsidian, Notion is initially easier to
            take notes with. This is especially true for users who don’t know
            Markdown. Notion’s UX is more beginner friendly and it’s relatively
            easy to figure out how to use all of the content features. This is
            due both to where they are placed within the app as well as the
            unobtrusive pop-up that explains what each feature is when you hover
            over it. Having said that, some users may find it faster to take
            notes using Obsidian. This is especially true if the user is
            proficient with Markdown, is confident using technology, and can
            learn new applications quickly.
