          <h2>Workflows in Notion & Obsidian (UI Overview)</h2>
          <h3 id="attention">Attention Graph</h3>
          <p>
            It is important to understand how a technology product engages
            attention. In
            <span class="italic"
              >Calm Technology: Principles and Patterns for Non-Intrusive
              Design</span
            >, Amber Case distinguishes three forms of attention: primary,
            secondary, and tertiary. Here, we add three stages (pre-task,
            primary task, and post-task) to the attention graph below in order
            to distinguish three crucial phases when the user engages with the
            technology product.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/attention-graph.jpg"
            alt="An attention graph of a note-taking app showing the three stages of attention" />
          <p>
            Special attention should be paid to the high points of this arc.
            During the high-attention phases of writing the note and retrieving
            the note, the user is engaging the most directly with the app.
            Primary task completion likely hinges on the user engaging longer in
            the pre-task phase and shorter in the primary task phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the user is opening and closing the app, the app is likely
            occupying their secondary form of attention while they transition to
            a new primary task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, saving notes increases the required amount of
            attention a user must dedicate to the app, so saving and
            organization workflows should also be closely monitored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the duration in which the note is forgotten by the user
            does not clearly indicate usefulness of the entire app. A user may
            forget one note but continue drafting/organizing other notes.
