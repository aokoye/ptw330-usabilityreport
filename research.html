          <h2>Usability Research</h2>
          <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            Team-member facilitators conducted usability testing across two
            note-taking apps: Notion and Obsidian. Team members observed and
            interviewed one (or two) users for a total of five participants.
            Each participant was asked to complete a series of tasks in either
            Notion or Obsidian.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants completed a questionnaire before the interview.
            Facilitators reviewed the responses for exclusion criteria. Consent
            forms were filled out by the participant collected. Facilitators
            used a script to standardize the team’s data collection method. Then
            we conducted remote, qualitative usability tests using the
            <a
              href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/"
              >think-aloud protocol</a
            >. Researcher notes and user survey results were compiled and
            compared. Noteworthy findings or discrepancies between field testing
            and user reflection are reported in the Usability Results section.
          </p>
          <h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
          <p>
            In alignment with Jakob Nielsen’s findings that
            <a
              href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/"
              >testing 5 users reveals 85% of problems</a
            >, the team will recruit six people to balance the number of users
            per app. Team members recruited one or two users through their
            personal network.
          </p>
          <h4 id="recruitment">Recruitment Criteria</h4>
          <p>Priorities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants who do not have experience with either Notion or
              Obsidian.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants may have experience with other note-taking apps.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Exclusions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants who have previously downloaded Notion or Obsidian.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
          <p>
            Participants signed a consent form. Their consent gave the
            facilitator permission to record the user’s audio and screen
            activity for data collection purposes.
          </p>
          <h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose one app for the user to test: Obsidian or Notion.</li>
            <li>
              Ask participant to complete the Pre-interview Questionnaire.
            </li>
            <li>Review Pre-Interview data for exclusion criteria.</li>
            <li>Ask participant to sign consent.</li>
            <li>Welcome the user.</li>
            <li>Ask opening questions.</li>
            <li>Introduce the “Think Aloud Protocol.”</li>
            <li>Set up recording.</li>
            <li>

                <li>Create a New Note.</li>
                <li>Format a note.</li>
                <li>
                  Assign a note to a category or move to a folder (Notion) or
                  “vault” (Obsidian).
                </li>
                <li>Access a note.</li>
                <li>Use a template to create a note.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Time Managements of User Tasks
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Allow the user to proceed for up to three minutes - until you
                  don’t feel like it’s producing any value or the user becomes
                  highly frustrated.
                </li>
                <li>Proceed with tasks until complete or time runs out.</li>
                <li>
                  Stop Tasks and move on to Closing Questions after 40 minutes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ask follow-up Closing Questions.</li>
            <li>Thank the User.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="aboutsession">About the Session</h3>
          <p>
            Participants joined a 60-minute recorded session in person or on
            Zoom via their personal device. The session proceeded in the
            following format:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>5 minutes: Introduction</li>
            <li>5 minutes: Initial questions</li>
            <li>5 minutes: Set up screen-sharing</li>
            <li>
              40 minutes: Tasks administered; researcher asks follow-up
              questions after each task
            </li>
            <li>5 minutes: Final survey</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Participants chose the device to use for task completion. They were
            prompted to explain why they selected that device.
